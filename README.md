# Programming Class Code Repository

This repository contains programs created during programming classes. Please note that the majority of these codes do not have documentation and do not include explanations of their purpose.

These programs are intended for educational purposes and are not intended for production use. They may contain bugs and errors, and some of them may not be optimized for performance.

If you plan to use any of these programs for your own projects, it is recommended that you thoroughly review and test them to ensure they meet your requirements. You should also consider adding your own documentation to the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

Please be aware that the instructors and contributors to this repository are not responsible for any damages or issues that may arise from the use of these programs. Use them at your own risk.
